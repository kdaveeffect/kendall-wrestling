<h2>Where It Began</h2><img src="https://ewrestling.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_photo_1284x722/public/2018-06/the-ultimate-warrior.jpg?itok=zRH_CPVY" width="300"</h2>
<p>My fandom journey began in the late 80s/early 90s. I have vague memories of "The Federation Years" and the late NWA/early WCW era, however my attention was mostly on the WWF/E. After a short break, I returned to watch wrestling in the fall of 1994.</p>

<h2>My First Life Event</h2><img src="https://www.wave3.com/resizer/XnRmXLxPMKgPMo86NEZ8BzQtA2k=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-raycom.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKRYPS6KXRBO3PMG37TI6CN634.jpg" width="300"</h2>

<p>Friday Night, February 17, 1995. The "In High Gear" tour, Louisville Gardens. My grandfather (who acted like he hated wrasslin but would always ask me for updates) took me and my best friend Rod to a house show!</p>

<h2>Favorite Wrestlers</h2><img src="https://tidemarktheatre.com/content/uploads/2019/04/Bret.jpg" width="300">

<div id="the-hitman"><h6>Bret "Hitman" Hart</h6>
<p>Lots of performers whose work I enjoyed, but look...Bret is my guy. The swagger, sunglasses..MAN I WANTED A PAIR OF THOSE SUNGLASSES FROM HIM SO BAD! He is the reason WM 10 is my favorite of all-time! Fun Fact: My favorite match of all-time is one that he lost! (Vs. Owen at WM 10)</p></div>

<h6>"Macho Man" Randy Savage</h6>

<p>Randy Savage had 2 of the most<strong> THRILL RIDE</strong> emotional matches I have ever seen. Wrestlemanias 7 and 8..I suggest you watch</p>

<h6>Chris Jericho</h6> 
  <p>As of Early 2021 as im writing and coding this..Jericho is STILL kicking! In my opinion, his best work came in the late 1990s, as a cruiserweight in the undercard. The promos were so funny, the wrestling was good and I was HOOKED. Jericholic since 1998...</p>

  <h6>Ultimate <span class="hellwig">Warrior</span></h6>

<p>I was a young dude, the colors, the energy, the facepaint, the music, it was my BAG! Also it seemed a little counter culture to Hulkamania!</p>

<h2> AEW VS WWE </h2>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2568/1*BVEVJQMA6Lir2Ckqf4QHig.jpeg" width="300">

<p>For decades, WWF/E was the standard in sports entertainment/wrestling and my #1 company I enjoyed. In October 2019, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) came along, and honestly In have enjoyed the product more than WWE.</p>
